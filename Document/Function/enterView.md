This full implementation of this example is [enter-view.jspkg](https://github.com/steelwheels/JSTerminal/tree/master/Resource/Sample/enter-view.jspkg).


This is main-view. The return value of `enterView` function is
given by `leaveView` function in sub-view. 
The variable `ret` will have following object:
`{message: string, a: number, b: number}`.

````
top: VBox {
    enter_button: Button {
   	title: String "SubView"
	pressed: Event() %{
		let ret = enterView("sub") ;
		console.log("message: " + ret.message
                        + ", a = " + ret.a 
                        + ", b = " + ret.b
                ) ;
        %}
    }
    ...

		leaveView({
                  message: "Good bye sub view",
                  a: 10,
                  b: 20
                }) ;
        %}
